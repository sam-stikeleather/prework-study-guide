# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The following project was completed in an effort to gain knowledge on coding and web development for someone who has had zero experience in the field. I faced several challenges throughout this endeavor, including but not limited to losing all of my work multiple times, not being able to locate files, and being completely overwhelmed by an onslaught of information. I learned a lot about coding as a whole, but more specifically about JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and other formats and methods of coding.
